# Overview

You can find Rabea's introduction notebook here: [Introduction to python](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/scholich/python-overview/blob/master/Python_introduction.ipynb).

A more extensive introduction by Rick Muller, Sandia National Laboratories is the [Crash Course in Python](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/scholich/python-overview/blob/master/Crash_course_v0.6.ipynb)
that is also contained in this repository. You can download and run/execute it on your computer directly.

Also, there is a list of [Useful libraries for data science in Python](python_data_libraries.md).

You may also find an [introductory example](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/scholich/python-overview/blob/master/find_digits_and_predict.ipynb) to scikit-image and scikit-learn.

Marko Popovich provided a notebook with an [introduction to pandas](pandas_introduction.ipynb).

There is also a [notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/scholich/python-overview/blob/master/performance_strategies.ipynb) explaining how to speed-up parts of python code using Numba, Cython or parallel strategies.
